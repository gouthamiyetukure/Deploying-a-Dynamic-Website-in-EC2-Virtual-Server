# Deploying-a-Dynamic-Website-in-EC2-Virtual-Server

Deploying a dynamic website on an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) virtual server involves several steps:

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**: Choose the appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier) and configure your virtual server. Select an operating system, such as Ubuntu or Amazon Linux, and set up security groups to allow web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) and SSH for access.

2. **Install Web Server and Database**: After connecting to your EC2 instance via SSH, install a web server (like Apache or Nginx) and any necessary database (e.g., MySQL) for dynamic content. Also, install programming languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js, depending on your website's requirements.

3. **Deploy Your Website Code**: Upload your dynamic website's code (e.g., PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the EC2 instance, typically into the web server's root directory (e.g., `/var/www/html` for Apache).

4. **Configure Domain (Optional)**: If you want to link your website to a custom domain, configure DNS settings through a domain provider (like Route 53) to point to the EC2 instance's public IP.

5. **Ensure Security and Scalability**: Set up firewalls (security groups), enable SSL/TLS for HTTPS, and implement auto-scaling or load balancing if needed for handling traffic spikes.

6. **Test and Monitor**: Test the website for functionality and performance. Use AWS tools like CloudWatch to monitor your EC2 instance's health and website performance.
